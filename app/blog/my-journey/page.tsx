          Hi, I am Vamshi Nenu, a.k.a Vamshi Krishna Karnayna. Let&apos;s first
          talk about &quot;why not vamshikarnayana.com or any other domain
          name&quot;? Thank you for not asking this, but I am going to answer
          it. I am a programmer, I am a designer, I am a creative person. I am a
          lot of things, human too. But my creative instincts told me not to go
          with a big name, and also not to go with a non-creative one. So I
          thought, well, there are a lot of I&apos;s in what I do, so why not
          vamshi nenu (which means &quot;I&quot;). It&apos;s like saying{" "}
          <span className="italic">I am Vamshi</span> in Telugu, which is my
          mother tongue.
          <br />
          <br />
          Enough about the domain, I know you want to know about me. 09/20/2000
          is the day I started my journey. I began crying, eating, and sleeping
          for almost the first couple of years of my career. Then, 15 years
          later, I started the last year of my{" "}
          <span className="italic text-neutral-600">
            schooling at Ravindra Bharathi School
          </span>
          . I was told, always told, that I am not going to be a successful
          person. Maybe because I questioned a lot, or maybe the definition of
          success they gave didn&apos;t align with my journey. They (almost
          everyone but, my mom and best friends) thought I was going to fail the
          class. But I didn&apos;t. Instead,{" "}
          <span className="italic text-neutral-600">I got 83%</span>. I was busy
          reading textbooks and googling about Benzene, Friction, Gravity, and
          Numbers.
          <br />
          <br />
          Then, over the next two years{" "}
          <span className="italic text-neutral-600">2015-2017</span>, I was at{" "}
          <span className="text-neutral-600 italic">
            Gitam Junior College for high school
          </span>
          . I was overwhelmed with thoughts of what I could achieve with just
          numbers, integrals, and trigonometry. It made me a madman; I was so
          happy to just solve the entire textbook, like I was binge-watching
          Netflix, to be specific, Stranger Things. I was so busy doing all the
          maths that I was barely good enough at physics and chemistry. I was
          sad for the first time, not because I barely passed the language
          Sanskrit, but because I got 3 points less in Maths. But Math really
          helped me balance out my grades.{" "}
          <span className="italic text-neutral-600">I got 83%</span> again!
          I&apos;m not lying, Yes, I did get 83%. But don&apos;t worry,
          bachelors, are going to be worse. I promise.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span className="font-bold">4 years of chaos...</span>
          <br />
          <br />I was so confused about what to do next. Electrical
          Engineering?, Civil Engineering? I mean, all the engineering courses
          had some sort of numbers involved. But oh boy, computer science got
          into my mind. It felt like magic: you write some text, and run it, and
          the only limitation was your mind?.{" "}
          <span className="italic text-neutral-600">2017-2021</span> I started

            bachelor&apos;s in COMPUTER SCIENCE!!!!! at ACE Engineering College
          </span>
          . You can relate it to the day when you first encountered code. I was
          excited. 1st year, 1st semester. I was happy to be there, to learn how
          things work in the computer realm. But I was so confused; they started
          to teach me chemistry and physics. If they hadn&apos;t included math,
          I would&apos;ve lost my mind. I failed 3/5 courses. But hey, I got
          good grades in math. Here comes 1st year, 2nd semester. God damn it,
          This time it was Engineering drawing? and more Physics? but hey, they
          had 2 math courses, one was about calculus but complicated, and the
          other was about complex probability problems mwaaaaaah. I passed both.
          But not the other courses. I was called in by the head of the
          department about my progress. He said I am not good enough and need to
          work harder. I didn&apos;t care about what they were saying. I just
          nodded and said, &quot;yes sir&quot;. I did not care about the grades.
          I never did. I guess they were able to see that in my face, and they
          escalated this issue to my mom. Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ve got the
          chillest mom ever. She knew I was smart, she knew I was failing all
          these courses, but never said anything. In the 2nd Year, 1st semester,
          I took things into my hands, and started skipping classes. Not to do
          something fun. Just to go to the library, and read the holy grail C
          programming book. This semester did not have any computer
          science-related courses. I looked up and it would start the next
          semester. I was doing programs, like writing my own function to find
          the square root of a number, not just ^0.5, but actually dividing. I
          was so good at this. Next semester, I had nothing to do, because I had
          all the courses related to computer science, and I&apos;d read all of
          them. So it was time for me to pass the courses that I failed. and I
          did. except for (physics). 2nd year, 2nd semester, the semester, where
          I neither failed any courses nor got good grades, even though I had
          all the courses related to computer science. My answers/ code was
          always creative, I always used to show my cool tricks in coding, I
          guess they wanted a generic answer that was in textbooks. 2nd year,
          2nd semester, is when I encountered music. It has numbers too; it was
          all about balance and creativity. So{" "}
          <span className="text-neutral-600 italic">
            I made some music
          </span>{" "}
          under the name{" "}

          . I was getting good at coding, and I was getting good at music. And
          here comes COVID,{" "}
          <span className="text-neutral-600 italic">
            {" "}
            I learned Flutter, python, javascript, and some HTML, CSS, SQL, and
            mongodb.
          </span>
          . By using these, I built an app called{" "}
          <span className="text-neutral-600 italic">puppet</span>, an
          application that would go through all your PDFs and let you search by
          text and it would send you the right page on a PDF. I am creative,
          Hey, I am not bragging, but I am; let it be creating presentations, or
          creating apps that are useful and usable. I&apos;ve submitted this as
          my minor project, and I blew everyone&apos;s minds, with my
          presentation, my app, and the fact that I was the only one on the
          team, and the app really worked, unlike other submissions.
          <br />
          June 2021, The time of my bachelor&apos;s, where I needed to do a
          project, this is when I started my idea of creating a learning
          management system. I was so locked in. But as usual, everyone was not
          impressed with my idea. They wanted to see some AI, Machine Learning
          projects. So me and my team did a project that predicts future house
          prices based on the location. They were impressed, but I was not. Why?
          Because, there was not much coding, we just needed a dataset, and we
          needed to train them. Tada, that&apos;s it. I don&apos;t understand
          why AI was such a hype.
          <br />
          <br />
          Aug 2021 - Dec 2021, I worked on the courses that I failed, which
          included physics (the one from 1st year, yes, I finally made it in the
          last semester after 8 attempts), and other courses that weren&apos;t
          even related to computers! But I did it. I passed all of them. And
          parallelly, I worked on getting my admission for a Master&apos;s in
          the USA.
          <br />
          <br />
          Wait a minute, where is fun in all this?. There was only maths and
          coding, not really, I was a mischievous kid. I used to call the
          college, pretending to be my dad, and used to say that I was sick and
          then go to the movies, I was the head of the class too, a class
          representative, and I used to win with majority, I was a good leader,
          and I used to teach my friends, how to code, and fun fact, I used to
          give them my notes, that I used to prepare, from reading the
          textbooks, I used to summarize, a 400 page book, to 10-15 pages. I
          used to debate with my professors, about topics, just to make my team
          have some fun in class. I was all about MY TEAM. everyone was getting
          good grades, actually better than me. And It came to an end where, I
          was forced to not be the leader, because I was all about balance, fun
          and knowledge. But my professors only cared about the grades. It is
          what it is moment. I was soo good at coding, I even made{" "}
          <span className="text-neutral-600 italic">spowatch using python</span>
          , get source code from github. which would delete temp data of
          spotify, and restart in under a second, to eliminate ads lol.
          Techically I wasn&spos;t hacking, I was just restarting spotify kind
          of. And I made another script called{" "}
          <span className="italic text-neutral-600">killbill using python</span>
          , to remove background process that aren&apos;t needed to run anymore.
          why is chrome still running if I closed it... right!, updates? but I
          dont need to be on the latest version of chrome to watch youtube and
          browse github

          Dec 25, 2021, I reached the United States, for{" "}

          But again, It was not the gpa, I am here for, the people that I can
          meet and share my knowledge and in return get some of theirs. And I
          love it here, in the US. This is where My real journey/ purpose
          begins. First time ever I was noticed by professors, I was the best at
          my class, Stats, Data Mining, Text Mining, Big Data.
          <span className="text-neutral-600 italic">I made vaunner</span>, get
          it?, vamshi+runner, this was a script that I used to run my BigData
          python code, I was soo lazy to run couple of commands and moving files
          around and getting the output. I wrote a script, and was just running
          it. and was relaxing, in class, while others were just struggling to
          keep up with the next command that they need to run. Alot of scripts
          right... all about my vision of building visual apps. The Team I was
          in is the best, never made a number 2 project, Me and my team was

          A real time, Location based, Chat application. You could create
          groups, and talk with people that are in the same location and in same
          interest. Oct 2022, I got an offer to work at express scripts, now
          aquired by cigna insurance. I was happy, and was doing my best to
          learn, but most of the time I was confused, FYI, KPI, OOO, EOD, IMO,
          FYR, All I knew was WFH (work from home), thats what I did. But I
          learned really fast. I was creating some scripts on bash to migrate
          250 million records from one db to another. I migrated an old jaxrs
          app into spring boot, (this was fun). I fixed bugs, related to
          mulithreading. and More!. I worked the next 2 years, in this company.

          <br />
          Okay back to Aug, 2023, It was that time of my masters, where I needed
          to do a Major project. if you did not miss a section of this journey,
          you know I like some LMS (Learning Management System) and I like to
          build them. And yes that was my project, and I was suprised, this time
          I was appreciated. Everyone was mind blown. My professor (hey Dr.
          Joshua) asked me to make a presentation on how to make a presentation.
          Everyone loves my presentations, I dont use powerpoint,{" "}
          <span className="text-neutral-600 italic">
            I use Adobe AfterEffects.{" "}
          </span>
          I like to show how locked in I was with my team and project.
          <br />
          <br />I built a learning management system, and it was good, it was
          good to look at, and was easy to use, with complicated features,
          simplified with good UI,{" "}
          <span className="text-neutral-600 italic">
            I built Project Learnx, using sveltekit
          </span>
          , and It had basic features, that an LMS should have. But I was not
          impressed even though, my professor liked it. I wanted to take it to
          the next level, so here comes{" "}

          </a>
          , I started working on a fork of Project Learnx, adding in more
          features. Making it into an actual learning management system. Its in
          work in progress, since I am the only one working on it, and I work on
          the weekends.
